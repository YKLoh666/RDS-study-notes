- Design how subsystems interact
  - Interface
  - Distribution
  - Data Sharing
- Common models
  - **[Repository](#repository)**
  - **[Client-Server](#client-server)**
  - **[Layered](#layered)**

#### Repository

- All shared data held in a central database, accessed by all sub-systems
- Advantages:
  - Efficiently share large amounts of data
  - Centralized management of data
  - Sharing model is published as repository schema
  - Subsystems do not need to concern how data is produced
- Disadvantages:
  - Difficult to distribute
  - Subsystem compromised on single database schema
  - Difficult and expensive data evolution
  - No scope for specific management policies

#### Client-Server

- Distributed System

- Set of standalone servers provide services to multiple clients
- Clients make requests to servers, servers process requests and return results
- Advantages:
  - Distribution of data is straightforward
  - Effective network system, cheaper hardware
  - Easy to add or upgrade servers
- Disadvantages:
  - Inefficient data sharing due to different data model
  - Redundant Management
  - No central register of names and services (Hard to locate available services)

- Support incremental development
- Only adjacent layers are affected by changes

### System Decomposition

- Further decompose sub-systems into modules
- **Object-Oriented Decomposition**

  - [Broadcast Model](#broadcast-model)
  - [Interrupt-Driven Model](#interrupt-driven-model)

#### Call-Return Model

- Top down subroutine invocations
- **Sequential** system

#### Manager Model

- **Concurrent** system
- Manager controls the stopping, starting and synchronisation of other subsystems

#### Broadcast Model

- Event broadcast to all subsystems, only interested subsystems handle and respond to the event
- Effective in **integrating sub-systems distributed across computers on a network**

#### Interrupt-Driven Model

- Used in **Real-Time** systems
- Interrupt detected by interrupt handler and passed to some other component for processing

# Chapter 7 Software Testing

- **Validation Testing**: Ensure the system meets the requirements and works as expected
- **Defect Testing**: Discover faults and defects in the system
- Level of Testing
  - **[Unit Testing](#unit-testing)**
  - **[Integration Testing](#integration-testing)**

  - **[Acceptance Testing](#acceptance-testing)**

### Unit Testing

- Test individual units/components, typically at the function level
- Carried out by developers
- Verify that **the unit/component functions as intended and coded correctly**

### Integration Testing

- Test **interface** between two software units/modules
- Expose faults in the interaction between integrated units
- Carried out by developers
- **Techniques**
  - **Top-Down**: Test high level integration first, gradually replace lower level stubs with real modules
  - **Bottom-Up**: Test low level integration first, gradually replace higher level drivers with real modules
  - **Regression Testing**: Retest the system after changes to ensure no new faults are introduced (Expensive testing)

### System Testing

- Evaluate overall functionality and performance of the complete system
- Test if **requirements are met** and if the system is **ready for delivery**
- Carried out by an independent testing team

### Acceptance Testing

- Validate if the system is acceptable for operational use
- Final stage of development before delivery
- Carried out by the end users
- **Techniques**
  - **Beta Testing**: Deliver the system to a limited number of users to use in their own environment, expose faults found in real-world usage
  - **Black Box Testing**: Test system functionality without knowledge of internal workings, study the input and output
  - **Performance/Stress Testing**: Test using intended workload and overload conditions to evaluate performance and stability
  - **Back-to-Back Testing**: Compare the output of the new system with the output of an existing system for the same input data

### Source of Data

- **Live Data**: From DB, input from normal activities
  - Hard to obtain sufficient amount of data to conduct extensive testing
- **Artificial Data**: Generated data
  - Test all combinations of input data
  - Use data generating utility programs

  - Plan, prepare and think strategically to mitigate risks
  - Implement automated testing processes, code reviews and static code analysis tools
  - Create test plan from requirements analysis
- **Reactive Testing**
  - Respond to defects found during testing
  - Bug tracking systems to prioritize and assign developers to fix bugs
  - Post-mortem analysis to identify root causes of defects and implement corrective actions

### Test Planning

- Setting out **standard** for testing
- Includes
  - Testing Process (unit, integration, system, acceptance)
  - Traceability (link tests to requirements)
  - Tested Items (Program modules, user procedures, etc.)
  - Testing Schedule (Gantt chart)
  - Testing Recording Procedures (Test case ID, description, expected results, actual results, pass/fail status)
  - Hardware and Software Requirements
  - Constraints (Time, test item availability, etc.)
- Approaches of test case design
  - **Requirements-based**
  - **Partition Testing**: Identify input and output partitions, so the system executes inputs from all partitions and generates outputs in all partitions
  - **Structural Testing**: Use knowledge of the program structure to design test cases so it covers all parts of the program

### Test Principles

- All tests should be **traceable** to customer requirements
- Tests should be **planned long before** testing begins
- **Pareto Principle** is applied to software testing
  - 80% of defects found are likely to be found in 20% of the modules
  - Isolate suspect modules and focus testing effort on them
- Testing should begin in **small** and progress towards **larger scale** tests
- Exhaustive testing is **impossible**
  - Impossible to test all paths during testing (white box testing)
- To be most effective, testing should be **conducted by an independent** third party
  - Developers may be biased and overlook defects in their own code
